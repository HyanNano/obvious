XSLT injection using EXSLT extensions.

}

[Exploitation]{
XSLT injection using EXSLT extensions ( check fil.xslt ) and we got a shell.

users.db
  We got username : fismathack and password: 5b5c3ac3a1c897c94caad48e6c71fdec

  The password is hashed !
  We cracked it with hashcat and got the password Keepmesafeandwarm 
    
  Now log in with ssh with that username and password.
  We are in as fismathack, and got the user.txt.
