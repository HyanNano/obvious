Distract by an another attack, then Destroy it in one shot, and loot it!

  Here we should place a particular focus on the difference between tx.origin and msg.sender. Message sender is simply the address that called a particular function of a contract. This can be an EOA address(accounts that controlled with private keys) or a contract address. On the other hand, transaction origin is the address that signed the transaction, which is always an EOA. For example, say that we will call the attack function directly via our EOA. What we do is constructing a transaction with the input data, then sign and submit the transaction. In this case, our address is tx.origin and also msg.sender. However, lets say that we call another contracts (name it middleman) method initially and that contract calls the Creature contract’s attack function, in this case tx.origin would be our address and msg.sender would middleman’s address.

For this reason, what we have to do in our case is deploying a middleman contract and bypass this sanity check by calling attack function through the middleman. Additionally, since the aggro only changes in the first call, before using the middleman first we have to attack directly via our EOA.
