Why This Works

    ChaCha20 encryption: Ciphertext = Plaintext ⊕ Keystream
    Message: C₁ = M ⊕ K (where K is the keystream)
    Flag: C₂ = F ⊕ K (same keystream due to nonce reuse)
    XOR them: C₁ ⊕ C₂ = M ⊕ F
    XOR with M: (M ⊕ F) ⊕ M = F ✓

The FLAG is approximately 50 bytes long (based on the encrypted_flag hex length), so the attack recovers it completely using just the known plaintext
