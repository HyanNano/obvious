What the server does

    The server reads a single-line instruction string like H:0;CX:0,1;....
    It builds a 5-qubit quantum circuit and applies the requested gates.
    It measures all qubits repeatedly (many shots) and for each qubit concatenates the measured bits into a long bit-string (a share).
    It checks these conditions:

    share0 == share1 == share3
    share2 == share4
    share2/4 != share0/1/3

If the check passes, it prints the flag from flag.txt.
Why this is exploitable (intuitive)

    A H (Hadamard) gate makes a qubit produce random measurement outcomes (like a fair coin flip) on every shot.
    A CX (CNOT) with control A and target B makes B’s measured bit match A’s measured bit for each shot (if B started at 0).
    So: make qubit 0 random and copy it into qubit 1 and qubit 3 → share0 == share1 == share3.
    Make qubit 2 random and copy it into qubit 4 → share2 == share4.
    Because qubit 0 and qubit 2 are independent random sources, their long bit-strings will almost always differ → share2 != share0.

Exploit / Payload (exact string)

H:0;CX:0,1;CX:0,3;H:2;CX:2,4

What it does

    H:0 — make qubit 0 random each shot.
    CX:0,1 and CX:0,3 — copy qubit 0’s result to qubits 1 and 3.
    H:2 — make qubit 2 random each shot (independent).
    CX:2,4 — copy qubit 2’s result to qubit 4.
