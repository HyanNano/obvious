messages --- long / short (Table I to III)

Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem (BCH) error-correcting bits by using a BCH (82.61) code 

Transmit the message in a Biphase-L format at a bit rate of 400 bps

Transmit the message every 50 sec with a jitter of +/- 2.5 sec.

Determine emergency code (Table IV and V)

# Encryption mechanism

Biphase-L encoding is a method used to encode data where each bit is represented by a transition in the signal. At a bit rate of 400 bps, the signal would have a transition for each bit, allowing for reliable data transmission.
